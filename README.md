- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlexN0va
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about science! If I had to choose six words that would describe my life, those would be the exact six words. Let me analyze those six words for you.
-     My interest and passion lies in learning about the world around us by learning but also being able to take on different perspectives as well as my very own perspective. 
-     As a human I am naturally curious and want to help the world. I believe I can do this by learning and more importantly applying what I learn. Science.... 
-     science is very vague word but I think it fits perfectly, I am specifically interested in the sciences of computer science. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Java, C++,  
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Arduino projects, Python projects, C++ projects, game design
